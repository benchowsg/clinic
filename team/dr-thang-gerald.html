          <p>Dr. Gerald Thang founded A Healing Heart Medical Clinic with a singular mission: to provide an ideal healing environment that addresses both the physical and emotional aspects of cardiovascular health. With nearly two decades of clinical experience across Singapore’s major healthcare institutions, including SGH, TTSH, and KTPH, Dr. Thang recognized a critical gap in the traditional care model: the lack of a structured bridge between acute hospital intervention and long term home recovery.</p>

          <p>As the <strong>Principal Physician</strong>, Dr. Thang strongly believes that the intermediate care approach ensures that patients are not simply "discharged," but are guided through a clinical transition that involves meticulous risk stratification, medication optimization, and rehabilitative oversight. His expertise in Cardiology allows him to interpret complex diagnostics, such as CT Coronary Angiograms and Echocardiograms, through the lens of personalized prevention.</p>

          <p>Dr. Thang’s clinical philosophy is rooted in the belief that "chasing numbers" is only one part of the journey. He focuses on Metabolic Synergy, looking at how genetic markers like Lp(a) interact with a patient's overall lifestyle and physiology. By integrating advanced cardiac diagnostics with a compassionate, patient centered approach, he helps individuals navigate their health with clarity and confidence.</p>
