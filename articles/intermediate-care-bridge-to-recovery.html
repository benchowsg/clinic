          <p>The transition from an acute hospital ward to the home environment is often the most vulnerable period for a cardiac patient. While acute care focuses on stabilizing a crisis—such as a heart attack or major surgery—<strong>Intermediate Care</strong> serves as the essential clinical "bridge" that ensures long-term stability. In Singapore’s healthcare landscape, this phase is designed to provide continued medical supervision and intensive rehabilitation without the high-intensity environment of an acute hospital, allowing the patient to regain their functional independence in a structured setting.</p>

            "Intermediate care is not just a place to wait; it is a period of active recovery designed to reduce the risk of hospital readmission."
          </div>

          <p>For many patients, especially the elderly or those with complex multi-morbidities, returning home immediately after discharge can be overwhelming. Intermediate care focuses on <strong>Rehabilitative Optimization</strong>: ensuring that medications are adjusted to real-world activity levels and that physical therapy is tailored to the patient’s home requirements. By providing this 'buffer' zone, we can address subtle clinical changes early—such as fluid fluctuations or rhythm variations—that might otherwise lead to an emergency room visit if the patient were unmonitored at home.</p>

          

          <p>Ultimately, the goal of intermediate care is to empower both the patient and their caregivers. It provides a safe space for "caregiver training," where family members can learn to manage complex cardiac regimes under professional guidance. This reduces caregiver anxiety and builds the patient's confidence, ensuring that when they finally cross the bridge back to their own home, the recovery is permanent and the risk of relapse is minimized.</p>
