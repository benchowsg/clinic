        <div class="article-body">
          <p>The traditional healthcare journey often faces a significant drop-off point: the moment a patient is discharged from an acute hospital setting. While the hospital successfully manages the crisis, the transition to the home environment is where long-term recovery is either solidified or compromised. This gap is what necessitated the development of a more sophisticated clinical framework.</p>

          <div class="highlight-bridge">
            <h5 class="fw-bold">The Principal Physician’s Framework</h5>
            <p class="mb-0"><strong>Dr. Gerald Thang believes that the intermediate care approach ensures that patients are not simply discharged, but are guided through a clinical transition that involves meticulous risk stratification, medication optimization, and rehabilitative oversight.</strong></p>
          </div>

          <p>This model moves away from the "one-off" discharge summary and toward a period of active clinical stewardship. In this phase, the Principal Physician acts as the clinical anchor, ensuring that the progress made during hospitalization is not lost. By implementing a high-resolution oversight strategy, we can address the physiological nuances, such as subtle fluid shifts or autonomic adjustments, that often go unnoticed in the first few weeks following a cardiac event.</p>

          

          <p>Meticulous risk stratification is at the core of this bridge. It is not merely about checking vitals; it is about predicting potential setbacks before they require a readmission. This involves a deep-dive into the patient's data, correlating post-acute diagnostics with real-world functional recovery. Similarly, medication optimization is viewed as a dynamic process, adjusting dosages in real-time as the patient's body adapts to their home environment and rehabilitative efforts.</p>

          <p>Ultimately, Intermediate Care provides the psychological and physical buffer required for a permanent recovery. It empowers patients and their families by providing a structured, medically supervised pathway home, ensuring that the "Bridge to Recovery" is a safe and sustainable one.</p>
