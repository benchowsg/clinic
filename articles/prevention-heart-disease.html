          <p class="lead">Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death in Singapore. However, the good news is that many cardiovascular conditions are highly preventable through early detection and lifestyle modification.</p>

          <p>In my clinical practice at <strong>A Healing Heart Medical</strong>, I emphasize that prevention is not just about avoiding "bad habits"—it is about understanding your unique risk profile through intermediate care and regular screening.</p>

          <h2>1. Know Your Numbers (The "Healthier SG" Approach)</h2>
          <p>The first step in prevention is data. Under the <strong>Healthier SG</strong> initiative, we encourage all Singaporeans to stay updated with their screenings. You should be aware of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Blood Pressure:</strong> Ideally below 130/80 mmHg.</li>
            <li><strong>Cholesterol (LDL):</strong> Lowering "bad" cholesterol significantly reduces plaque buildup.</li>
            <li><strong>Blood Glucose:</strong> Managing pre-diabetes prevents long-term heart damage.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. The Role of Intermediate Care</h2>
          <p>Prevention isn't just for those who feel healthy. For patients recovering from minor cardiac events or those with complex chronic conditions, <strong>intermediate care</strong> bridges the gap. It provides a more intensive level of monitoring than a standard GP visit but without the stress of a hospital environment.</p>

          <h2>3. Dietary Habits in a Food Paradise</h2>
          <p>Living in Singapore makes it hard to avoid high-sodium and high-sugar foods. I advise my patients to follow the <strong>"My Healthy Plate"</strong> guide by the Health Promotion Board (HPB):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fill half your plate with fruit and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Choose whole grains (brown rice or wholemeal bread).</li>
            <li>Opt for lean proteins like fish or soy.</li>
          </ul>

          

          <h2>4. Active Prevention</h2>
          <p>Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. This can be as simple as brisk walking through Geylang East Park or cycling along the PCN. Exercise strengthens the heart muscle and improves vascular flexibility.</p>
