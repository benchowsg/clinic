          <p>Many Singaporeans undergo "screening" as part of their annual work-checkup, but cardiac screening is often more nuanced. The goal of heart screening is to detect subclinical cardiovascular disease—conditions that may not yet show symptoms but pose a risk for the future.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <strong>Medical Note:</strong> Screening is most effective when tailored to an individual’s risk factors such as age, family history, and lifestyle.
          </div>

          <h2>Common Cardiac Assessment Tools</h2>
          <p>In a clinical setting, several tools are used to assess heart health. Each serves a different diagnostic purpose:</p>

          <h4>1. Electrocardiogram (ECG)</h4>
          <p>A basic test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It is useful for detecting arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats) or signs of a previous heart attack.</p>

          

          <h4>2. Exercise Stress Test (Treadmill)</h4>
          <p>This monitors how your heart responds to physical stress. It is often used to detect coronary artery disease that might not be visible while the heart is at rest.</p>

          <h4>3. Echocardiogram (Heart Ultrasound)</h4>
          <p>An ultrasound that allows the doctor to see the heart’s structure, including the valves and the pumping strength of the heart chambers.</p>
          
          

          <h2>Who Should Consider Screening?</h2>
          <p>Under the <strong>Healthier SG</strong> framework, risk-based screening is encouraged. You should speak with a doctor about a cardiac evaluation if you experience:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Persistent chest discomfort or breathlessness.</li>
            <li>A strong family history of early-onset heart disease.</li>
            <li>Known chronic conditions like Hypertension or Diabetes.</li>
          </ul>
