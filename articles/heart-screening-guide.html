          <p class="lead">In modern cardiology, heart screening has shifted from simple "fitness checks" to advanced diagnostic imaging that provides definitive answers about your arterial health.</p>

          <p>The goal is no longer just to see if the heart can "handle stress," but to look directly at the coronary anatomy to prevent events before they occur.</p>

          <h2>1. Advanced Imaging: The Definitive Choice</h2>
          <p>For many patients, especially those with risk factors like high cholesterol or a family history of heart disease, advanced scans offer the highest degree of certainty. Unlike traditional tests, these scans allow us to see the actual state of your blood vessels.</p>

          <h4>CT Coronary Angiogram (CTCA)</h4>
          <p>This is a non-invasive scan that uses advanced X-ray technology to create a detailed 3D map of your heart's arteries. It is the most definitive way to identify narrowings or blockages without an invasive procedure.</p>
          

          <h4>CT Calcium Score</h4>
          <p>A quick, painless scan that measures the amount of calcified plaque in your coronary arteries. A higher score correlates with a higher risk of future heart attacks, allowing for early intervention.</p>

          <h2>2. Structural Assessment</h2>
          <h4>Echocardiogram (Heart Ultrasound)</h4>
          <p>While CT scans look at the "plumbing" (arteries), the Echocardiogram looks at the "pump." This ultrasound allows the doctor to check the heart's valves and its overall pumping strength (ejection fraction).</p>
          

          <h2>3. Baseline Rhythm Checks</h2>
          <h4>Electrocardiogram (ECG)</h4>
          <p>A fundamental test that records the heart’s electrical signals. It is primarily used to detect heart rhythm irregularities (arrhythmias) or signs of previous heart muscle damage.</p>

          <h2>4. The Exercise Stress Test (Treadmill)</h2>
          <p>Once the standard for heart screening, the treadmill test is now considered a secondary tool. It monitors the heart's electrical response to exercise, but it is an <em>indirect</em> assessment and can sometimes provide less conclusive results compared to modern imaging.</p>

                  <li>Cannot "see" the actual arteries or plaque.</li>
                  <li>Higher rate of false positives/negatives.</li>
                  <li>Unsuitable for those with mobility or joint issues.</li>

            <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> If you are seeking a definitive answer regarding the presence of coronary artery disease, a CT-based scan is often more reliable than a treadmill test.
